# RC-Vehicle
 Project built using an ESP32 with MQTT protocol

This project was created to carry out telemetry and control of a remote control cart. In this project, a low memory consumption Bluetooth library NimBLE was used to receive commands from control devices, such as Forward, Right, Left, Reverse. For data telemetry, the MQTT communication protocol was implemented using the LOSANT system (IOT platform) which can demonstrate data presentation graphics in its system.
